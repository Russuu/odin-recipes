        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Polenta is nothing more than coarsely ground cornmeal. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts water, but I like to measure the polenta just a little scant of a full cup. I often use chicken broth instead of water. It's a great base for any kind of saucy meat or mushroom ragout.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 cup polenta</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>1/2 Parmigiano-Reggioano</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes. When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender. </li>
        <li>Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until butter partially melts; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes to thicken. </li>
        <li>Stir polenta and transfer to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and about 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish. </li>
